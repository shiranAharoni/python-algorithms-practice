Merge and Sort Intervals
Given an array of intervals [startTime, endTime], merge all overlapping intervals and return a sorted array of non-overlapping intervals.

Example:
Input:
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Output:
[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Explanation:
- Step 1: Sort intervals by start time (already sorted). 
- Step 2: Initialize merged list with first interval [1,3]. 
- Step 3: Compare [2,6] with last merged [1,3]. They overlap (2 â‰¤ 3), so merge into [1,6]. Step 4: Compare [8,10] with last merged [1,6]. No overlap (8 > 6), append [8,10]. 
- Step 5: Compare [15,18] with last merged [8,10]. No overlap (15 > 10), append [15,18]. 

Result: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]].
