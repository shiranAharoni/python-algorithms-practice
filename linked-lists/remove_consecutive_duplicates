"""
Write a function "deleteDuplicates" that removes consecutive duplicate nodes in-place, retaining only the first node of each code. Return the head of the resulting list.

Example

Input
head = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

Output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Explanation
- Given 1→2→2→2→3→4→4→5. 
- Start at 1 (next is 2, no skip). 
- Move to 2; skip all consecutive 2's so that 2 links directly to 3 (removing two extra 2 nodes). 
- Now list is 1→2→3→4→4→5.
- Move to 3 (next is 4, no skip). 
- At 4, skip the duplicate 4 so it links to 5. 
- The resulting list is 1→2→3→4→5.
