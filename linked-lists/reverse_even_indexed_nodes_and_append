Reverse Even-Indexed Nodes and Append
Given a singly linked list, extract all even-indexed nodes, reverse their order, and append them to the end of the list in one traversal. Return the head of the modified list.
Example:
Input
head = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

Output
[20, 40, 60, 50, 30, 10

Explanation
- Step 1: Extract sponsored nodes at even positions 0, 2, 4 → [10, 30, 50]. 
- Step 2: Remaining non-sponsored nodes are [20, 40, 60]. 
- Step 3: Reverse the extracted sponsored list → [50, 30, 10]. 
- Step 4: Append the reversed list to [20, 40, 60], yielding [20, 40, 60, 50, 30, 10].
